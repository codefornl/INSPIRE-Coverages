## PoC Workshop

Repository: https://github.com/codefornl/INSPIRE-coverages

# Thursday 18 November 2021 13:15 - 15:30
Online

# Purpose
Sharing the results and experiences with the INSPIRE GoodPractice Coverages.
We will show and interact the results and a bit of use. The promairy focus will be on support the provision.

# Agenda

## The Goal: a FAIR world. 
Imagine a world where the data you require is findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable. 

## The Present: not there yet!
Data is locked in organizational DBs, in diverse formats, difficult to access and use

## The Issues: what’s keeping us from the Future?
There are various issues with the INSPIRE Coverage Data Models and TG for WCS, now mostly resolved by the INSPIRE Coverage Good Practice and developments by GeoSolutions and Rasdaman.

## The way Forward: what do we do?
- How to extract the data from its current location, prepare for provision
- How to import the data to a WCS
- How to use the data available from a WCS

## The Future: slowly but surely, the world is becoming FAIR


# Target audience
Current providers, not users. 
Team members Data-providers (AHN, Bathymetry, WaterInfo, orthofoto's e.a. uit Duitsland, België, Luxemburg)
Team members INSPIRE-services RWS (RWS, Sweco, WetRansform, PDOK)
Team members INSPIRE operationeel overleg (MinBzK, MinIenW)
Gebruikers en studenten grensoverschrijdende raster en sensor data (Copernicus, SeadataNed, OSPAR, ISRIC, ...)

# Explanation
Raster data (coverages) are extremely important to spatially analyze dynamic phenomena such as soilchanges, floading, noise pollution.
To do this across international borders, an INSPIRE GoodPractice coverages was established at the beginning of 2021. In order to bring the experts together and get to know the process, the components and the issues, a Proof off Concept (PoC) has been carried out since September.

# PoC
The PoC INSPIRE Goodpractivce Coverages includes the INSPIRE compliant provision of grid and if possible sensor data.
There is knowledge and experience gained with the collecting, conversion and publication of the coverage data. 

In the PoC we process AS-IS data from the source into the data as defined by INSPIRE. 
In the data we distinguish bathymetry, altitude and water quality and water quantity related data.

Expected results are:
- Process
- Experiences
- Issues and solutions
- INSPIRE Goodpractice compliant services

# Participants
The following parties are participating in the chain: JRC, MinBzK, Geonovum, INSPIRE operational consultation, Sweco, DataCov, WetRansform, PDOK and Rijkswaterstaat.
