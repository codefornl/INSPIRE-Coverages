## OGC Web Services
OGC Web Services (OWS) compose a suite of related web services, tailored for the provision of various types of OGC data models. The following list shows the core OWS:

- [Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms): provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. 
- [Web Feature Service (WFS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs): offers direct fine-grained access to geographic information at the feature and feature property level.
- [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs): offers multi-dimensional coverage data for access over the Internet. 
- [Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcps): defines a protocol-independent language for the extraction, processing, and analysis of multi-dimensional coverages representing sensor, image, or statistics data.
- [Sensor Observation Service (SOS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sos):  allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations. 
- [Catalogue Service Web (CSW)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/cat): support the ability to publish and search collections of descriptive information (metadata) for data, services, and related information objects.
