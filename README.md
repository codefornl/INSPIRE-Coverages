# INSPIRE-Coverages
A repository for collecting and distributing information on INSPIRE Coverages


## Goals

Provide Elevation and Bathymetry data with WCS on a 1 and 10m grid for the NL Limburg area, following [INSPIRE Good Practice (GP)](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/good-practice/ogc-compliant-inspire-coverage-data-and-service-implementation). This data will be complemented with point based measurement data (e.g. water levels, precipitation forecast) provided via SensorThings API. The results together with usage examples will be presented at the final workshop.
