# INSPIRE-Coverages
A repository for collecting and distributing information on INSPIRE Coverages

## Workshop 
Direct connected with the dutch Geoforum (https://geoforum.nl/t/inspire-coverages)

Date: **Thursday 18 November, 13:15 - 15:30**

### Agenda

#### The Goal: a FAIR world. 
Imagine a world where the data you require is findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable. 

#### The Present: not there yet!
Data is locked in organizational DBs, in diverse formats, difficult to access and use

#### The Issues: whatâ€™s keeping us from the Future?
There are various issues with the INSPIRE Coverage Data Models and TG for WCS, now mostly resolved by the INSPIRE Coverage Good Practice and developments by GeoSolutions and Rasdaman.

#### The way Forward: what do we do?
- How to extract the data from its current location, prepare for provision
- How to import the data to a WCS
- How to use the data available from a WCS

#### The Future: slowly but surely, the world is becoming FAIR

## Goals

Provide Elevation and Bathymetry data with WCS on a 1 and 10m grid for the NL Limburg area, following [INSPIRE Good Practice (GP)](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/good-practice/ogc-compliant-inspire-coverage-data-and-service-implementation). This data will be complemented with point based measurement data (e.g. water levels, precipitation forecast) provided via SensorThings API. The results together with usage examples will be presented at the final workshop.
